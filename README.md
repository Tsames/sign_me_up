## Sign Me Up

Sign Me Up is a RESTful web app for events. Unauthenticated users can browse posted events. While autheticated users can create and sign up to attend events. Additionally, the user that originally created the event is the only one that has permission to edit or delete that same event.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* Node
* Express
* Mongoose
* MongoDB

## Future Enhancements

Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I had really completed styling all pages of this app. Adding and refining styling to all pages is the most apparent enhancement that could still yet be made. However, in addition to the obvious, there are two big features I would have liked to have added:

* Filtering Listed Events by Location, Time, Organizer, and Attendees
* Adding the ability to friend another user and view events they are attending or have created
